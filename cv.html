                <h1>Education</h1>
                <p>During high school I picked subjects that I knew would benefit me in later life. These included:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Spanish (C)</li>
                  <li>Vocational IT (pass)</li>
                  <li>History (C)</li>
                  <li>Business studies (C)</li>
                </ul>
                I also passed all the core subjects.

                <h1>Key skills</h1>
                <p>I like to think that I have vital key skils that help me excel in a work environment. I believe I possess great social skills which has particularly developed in my current job of working in a pub. I also believe I excel in both group
                    and individual projects. I am also very competent in both html 5 and css. </p>

                <h1>Previous experience</h1>
                <p>I spent a week at Cablecom Training, a local training firm for telecom and network purposes. On this week I learnt the essentials for a network system around the like of offices. In the final days I had a project of creating a working
                    system. I feel like it is safe to say it was a great experience which I think I will carry on into a possible career in the I.T world.</p>
